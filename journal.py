# === Project Setup ===
# Step 1: Install necessary libraries (if not already installed)
# - tkinter for UI
# - requests for API interaction (if needed)
# - numpy or pandas for data handling (if needed)

# Step 2: Set up your programming environment
# - Choose and set up your IDE or text editor
# - Ensure Python is correctly installed and paths are set

# === Game Design ===
# Step 3: Understand and define game mechanics
# - Clearly define how dice rolls, character creation, journaling, and end-game conditions work

# Step 4: Design the UI layout
# - Sketch out a preliminary design of the UI, focusing on usability and game flow

# === Implementation Phases ===
# Step 5: Implement the basic UI setup
# - Create the main window
import tkinter as tk
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("ONE PAGE LEFT - Horror Survival RPG")

# - Add a Text widget for the journal
text_widget = tk.Text(root, height=20, width=60)
text_widget.pack(pady=20)

# - Add buttons for game actions (e.g., roll dice, restart game)
button_frame = tk.Frame(root)
button_frame.pack()

roll_dice_button = tk.Button(button_frame, text="Roll Dice")
roll_dice_button.pack(side=tk.LEFT, padx=10)

restart_game_button = tk.Button(button_frame, text="Restart Game")
restart_game_button.pack(side=tk.LEFT, padx=10)

# Step 6: Implement game logic
# - Dice roll functionality
def roll_dice():
    import random
    return random.randint(1, 6)

# - Character and killer creation logic
# - Game progression logic based on the rules

# Step 7: Integrate LLM for story generation
# - Implement function to fetch story elements from LLM
# - Handle and parse LLM responses and integrate them into the game

# === Testing and Iteration ===
# Step 8: Perform functional testing
# - Test UI interactions
# - Test dice rolling mechanics and journal updates

# Step 9: Perform gameplay testing
# - Play the game to see how the mechanics and story unfold
# - Adjust game logic and UI based on gameplay experience

# Step 10: Collect user feedback (if possible)
# - Use feedback to refine game mechanics and UI

# === Finalization ===
# Step 11: Polish the UI
# - Refine the UI based on test and user feedback

# Step 12: Write documentation
# - Create simple documentation on how to install and play the game

# Step 13: Prepare for distribution
# - Package the game for distribution if planning to share it

# Run the tkinter main loop
root.mainloop()
